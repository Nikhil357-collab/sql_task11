# sql_task11
This project demonstrates how database indexing improves query performance on large datasets. It covers identifying slow queries, applying appropriate indexes, analyzing execution plans using EXPLAIN, and understanding when indexes help or hurt performance.

🎯 Objectives

Identify slow-running SQL queries on large datasets

Measure query performance before and after indexing

Use EXPLAIN to analyze execution plans

Understand clustered vs non-clustered indexes

Document best practices for indexing
